# `merge_sort.c`

This is my attempt on the popular **merge sorting** algorithm.  
I used a recursive logic to split and merge arrays, while sorting them in the process.

For array sizes, I made use of the good old `arlen` function, which you can find in the `arlen.c` file.  
There is a copy of arlen.c in this folder, if you'd like to check it out.

And if you'd like to learn more about arlen(), visit:

Please note that, unlike my `sort` function, merge sort works for `int`s only.  
It was actually what inspired `sort()`, so I cherish the program seriously.
